Classical ML data set to learn how fundamental principles work.<br>
For my experience, I learned what parameters influence the outcome and how to interpret provided data in order to put it in a model with a sound output. I tried several approaches, first attempting to understand the problem on my own, then moving on to readily available analyses and combining the solutions into something I thought would work best. There were additional tricks that I discovered that I could have used to improve my score, but in the end, I received a score of 0.72248.
